## Overview

VPN9 App is a cross-platform desktop and mobile VPN client built with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). It provides secure, anonymous VPN connections with a focus on privacy, transparency, and ease of use.

The application features a modern, responsive UI built with [Leptos](https://leptos.dev/) (Rust/WASM framework) and connects to VPN9's global server network to provide:

- **Anonymous account creation** - No email or personal information required
- **Zero-logs networking** - No connection or activity logs stored
- **Crypto-ready payments** - Privacy-focused payment options
- **Open-source transparency** - All client code is open for audit

## Features

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** (1.70 or later) - [Install Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
- **Node.js** (16 or later) - [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Trunk** - Install with `cargo install trunk`
- **Tauri CLI** - Install with `cargo install tauri-cli`

#### Platform-specific Requirements

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev \
    build-essential \
    curl \
    wget \
    file \
    libssl-dev \
    libayatana-appindicator3-dev \
    librsvg2-dev
```

**macOS:**
- Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`

**Windows:**
- [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
- WebView2 (comes with Windows 11 or Edge)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vpn9/vpn9-app.git
cd vpn9-app
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
# Install Rust/WASM target
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Install development tools
cargo install trunk tauri-cli
```

3. **Run in development mode:**
```bash
cargo tauri dev
```

4. **Build for production:**
```bash
cargo tauri build
```

The built application will be in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

└── Trunk.toml             # Frontend build config
```

### Architecture

The application uses a modern architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Frontend**: Leptos (Rust compiled to WASM) for reactive UI
- **Backend**: Tauri with Rust for system integration and VPN logic
- **Communication**: Type-safe IPC between frontend and backend
- **State Management**: Reactive signals for UI state

### Key Components

#### Authentication System
- Passphrase-based login with device fingerprinting
- JWT tokens for session management
- Secure storage using OS keyring (with encrypted file fallback)
- Automatic token refresh

#### VPN Connection Manager
- Server selection with real-time load information
- Connection state management
- Future support for WireGuard and OpenVPN protocols

#### Security Features
- Hybrid device identification (OS ID → UUID → Hardware fingerprint)
- Encrypted token storage with machine-specific keys
- Secure API communication with VPN9 backend

### Development Commands

```bash
# Run development server
cargo tauri dev

# Build for production
cargo tauri build

# Run frontend only (for UI development)
trunk serve

# Check Rust code
cargo check

# Run linter
cargo clippy

# Format code
cargo fmt
```

### API Endpoints

The app connects to VPN9's API at `https://vpn9.com/api/v1/`:

- `POST /auth/token` - Authenticate with passphrase
- `POST /auth/refresh` - Refresh access token
- `GET /relays` - Get list of VPN servers

## Building

### Desktop Builds

```bash
# Windows (.msi)
cargo tauri build --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc

# macOS (.app, .dmg)
cargo tauri build --target x86_64-apple-darwin
cargo tauri build --target aarch64-apple-darwin

# Linux (.deb, .AppImage)
cargo tauri build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

### Mobile Builds

Mobile support is coming soon. The app is designed with mobile in mind, featuring:
- Responsive UI that adapts to small screens
- Touch-friendly controls
- iOS and Android platform support via Tauri

## Security

### Token Storage

The application uses a multi-layered approach for secure token storage:

1. **Primary**: OS Keyring (Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service)
2. **Fallback**: Encrypted file storage with machine-specific keys
3. **Encryption**: XOR cipher with SHA256-hashed machine ID

### Device Identification

Three-tier device identification system:
1. **OS Machine ID**: Most reliable, platform-specific
2. **Persistent UUID**: Stored securely, survives reinstalls
3. **Hardware Fingerprint**: Last resort, based on system specs

### Best Practices

- No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- All sensitive data encrypted at rest
- Secure IPC communication between frontend and backend
- Regular security updates and dependency audits
